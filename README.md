# 🐾 Smart IoT Pet Feeder

![IoT Pet Feeder](https://your-image-link.com)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart IoT Pet Feeder** is an **ESP8266-based automated pet feeder** that allows pet owners to **schedule feedings, track food levels, and control feeding remotely** via Adafruit IO and Google Assistant. This ensures your pet is fed on time, even when you're not home.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Remote Feeding** - Feed your pet via Adafruit IO dashboard or voice commands.  
✅ **Scheduled Feeding** - Automatically dispenses food every **6 hours** when enabled.  
✅ **Food Level Monitoring** - Uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to measure food levels and display them on Adafruit IO.  
✅ **Google Assistant Integration** - Activate feeding with voice commands.  
✅ **Real-time Monitoring** - Displays feed count, last feed timestamp, and food level percentage.  
✅ **Automatic Feed Reset** - Daily reset of feed count at midnight.

## 💾 Software & Setup
### **1️⃣ Install Required Libraries**
Ensure you have the following Arduino libraries installed:

- [ESP8266WiFi](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
- [Adafruit MQTT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library)
- [Servo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/servo)
- [NTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient)

### **2️⃣ Adafruit IO Setup**
1. Create an account on [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/).
2. Create **3 feeds**:
   - `feed_count` (Integer) - Tracks the number of feedings.
   - `feed_timestamp` (String) - Stores the last feeding time.
   - `food_level` (Integer) - Displays food level percentage.
   - `scheduled_feed` (Boolean) - Toggles scheduled feeding mode.
3. Copy your **Adafruit IO Key & Username** into your code.

### **3️⃣ Upload the Code**
- Open **Arduino IDE**.
- Copy and paste the [IoT Pet Feeder Code](your-code-link.com).
- Upload it to your ESP8266 board.

## 📡 How It Works
### **🐾 Feeding Mechanism**
- When the **ON** command is sent via **Adafruit IO or Google Assistant**, the servo rotates, dispensing food.
- The **feed count** and **timestamp** are updated in the dashboard.

### **📊 Food Level Monitoring**
- The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** measures the distance from the lid to the food.
- The system converts this into a **percentage (100% = full, 0% = empty)** and displays it on Adafruit IO.

### **⏳ Scheduled Feeding Mode**
- When enabled, the system will **automatically dispense food every 6 hours**.
- Can be turned **ON/OFF via Adafruit IO**.

## 📱 Dashboard & Google Assistant
### **Adafruit IO Dashboard**
![Dashboard](https://your-dashboard-image-link.com)
- Toggle scheduled feeding mode.
- View live feed count, timestamp, and food level.

### **Google Assistant Voice Commands**
```
"Hey Google, feed my pet."
"Hey Google, check food level."
```
